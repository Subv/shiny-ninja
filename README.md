ShinyNinja
===========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Subv/shiny-ninja.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Subv/shiny-ninja)

GBA Emulator written in C++.
Uses Qt5 for the GUI.

ShinyNinja can also be started without a GUI using the "--no-gui" parameter followed by the path to the ROM file you want to load.
